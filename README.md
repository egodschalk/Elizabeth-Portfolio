# Elizabeth-Portfolio
This site is used to display my development projects as a professional portfolio.

The page includes information about me, a picture of me, my contact information in various forms, and links to my github and linkedin accounts.

There are also pictures of each of my projects that contain links to those websites. (So far, only the first project card works because I have not yet created any work for my portfolio, the others are placeholders).

The link to my portfolio is: 
https://egodschalk.github.io/Elizabeth-Portfolio/

The link to the GitHub repo for my portfolio is: 
https://github.com/egodschalk/Elizabeth-Portfolio

I also created a wireframe for this project:
